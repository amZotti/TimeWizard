<h1>Outcome</h1>
<p>Enable users to retroactively modify commit timestamps</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>While taking a Data Structures and Algorithms class I ran into an interesting
problem. I was creating high quality work that I would deffinetely want to be
able to reference later on, but due to the political nature of academia I was
unable to open source my content at that time. I decided I would go head, do my
coursework, and then just commit it later</p>

<p>A few months later my course was over and I wanted to commit my work. But
committing normally would not have the proper timestamp that would reflect when
I completed the work. I searched for an easy way to manupulate timestamps in Git
but shockingly there were none. From there on I decided to create TimeWizard
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add TimeWizard to home directory</li>
  <li>Add TimeWizard directory to your root path</li>
  <li>Use aliases <code>timewizard</code> and <code>timewizard_all</code> to commit a
single file or an entire directory respectively</li>
</ol>

<h3>timewizard</h3>
<b>Alias:</b>
<code>timewizard (full file name) (day number) (month number)</code>

<b>Example:</b>
  <code>timewizard "README.md" 28 8</code>
<a href="http://imgur.com/2vB9CjM"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2vB9CjM.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<h3>timewizard_all<h3>

<b>Alias:</b>
<code>timewizard_all (day number) (month number)</code>

<b>Example:</b>
  <code>timewizard 1 10</code>
<a href="http://imgur.com/R9bmYiT"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/R9bmYiT.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
<a href="https://github.com/amZotti/Java-Challenges">Success!</a>

<p>timewizard_all will process all files of a given file type
within whatever directory you are currently in. All these files will be
committed on their own day.</p> 

<p>If a user wants to disable auto-incrementing days they can just comment
out or delete the line in TimeWizardWrapper "days.next!". </p>

<p>If a user wants to specify the number of days they wish to increment by
they can do this by replacing "days.next!" with the following code:</p>

<pre>
days = days.to_i

days += (number you wish you increment days by)

days = days.to_s
</pre>

<h3>Defaults</h3>
The following are set by default and need to be changed manually in
TimeWizard.rb:
<ul>
  <li>Default year: "2014"</li>
  <li>Default commit message: "Completed #{name} challenge"</li>
</ul>
